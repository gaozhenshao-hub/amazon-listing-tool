## Voice Transcription Integration

Use the preconfigured voice transcription helper that converts speech to text using Whisper API, no manual setup required.

Example usage:
```ts
import { transcribeAudio } from "./server/_core/voiceTranscription";

const result = await transcribeAudio({
  audioUrl: "https://storage.example.com/audio/recording.mp3",
  language: "en", // Optional: helps improve accuracy
  prompt: "Transcribe meeting notes" // Optional: context hint
});

// Returns native Whisper API response
// result.text - Full transcription
// result.language - Detected language (ISO-639-1)
// result.segments - Timestamped segments with metadata
```

Tips
- Accepts URL to pre-uploaded audio file
- 16MB file size limit enforced during transcription, size flag to be set by frontend
- Supported formats: webm, mp3, wav, ogg, m4a
- Returns native Whisper API response with rich metadata
- Frontend should handle audio capture, storage upload, and size validation
