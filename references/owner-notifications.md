## Owner Notifications

This template already ships with a `notifyOwner({ title, content })` helper (`server/_core/notification.ts`) and a protected tRPC mutation at `trpc.system.notifyOwner`. Use it whenever backend logic needs to push an operational update to the Manus project owner—common triggers are new form submissions, survey feedback, or workflow results.

1. On the server, call `await notifyOwner({ title, content })` or reuse the provided `system.notifyOwner` mutation from jobs/webhooks (`trpc.system.notifyOwner.useMutation()` on the client).
2. Handle the boolean return (`true` on success, `false` if the upstream service is temporarily unavailable) to decide whether you need a fallback channel.

Keep this channel for owner-facing alerts; end-user messaging should flow through your app-specific systems.
